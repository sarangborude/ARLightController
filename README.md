# ARLightsController

Control your philips hue lamps with ARKit iOS app.

## How to use
1. Scan vertical planes like wall, a Yellow plane will indicate that the plane is detected.
2. Now tap on the plane to place the UI near the lamps. (This is a prototype, you will need to know how your philips hue lamps are added in your hue bridge, specifically their ID)
3. The way you place your UI depends on the sequence of your lamps. For eg. If you have a lamp in living room that has an id of 0 and then another lamp with id of 1, then place the UI near the lamp with id 0 and then near the id 1
4. Tap on Activate lights control, once you are done placing the lamps. 
5. tap and control the color picker to change the light of the lamps.
6. Use the color picker to pick colors from the camera feed and then set them to the lamp.
